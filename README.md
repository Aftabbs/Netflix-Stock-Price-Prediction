This project focuses on predicting the upcoming stock prices of Netflix using various machine learning techniques. The objective is to analyze historical stock data and build predictive models that can forecast future stock prices. The dataset used in this project contains the following columns: 'Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Adj Close', and 'Volume'.

# Project Steps
* Dataset Loading: The dataset, consisting of 1009 rows and 7 columns, was loaded for analysis and model building.

* Exploratory Data Analysis:

Five-Point Summary: The five-number summary (minimum, maximum, median, 1st quartile, and 3rd quartile) was calculated to understand the distribution and range of each feature.
Data Visualization: Box plots, histograms, and scatter plots were created to gain insights into the data.

Observations:
Most features follow a Gaussian distribution.
No outliers were detected based on the box plots.
Linear dependency was observed among the columns, indicating a linear relationship between different features.
No significant correlations were observed between the variables.

# Model Building:

* Linear Models: Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) models were implemented to predict stock prices.
  Linear Regression: Achieved the best RMSE of 4.45
  Predictions were visualized with respect to the date.

* GBR: Achieved an RMSE of 5.8  
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): LSTM model was employed to capture the temporal dependencies in the stock price data.
Predicted prices were plotted to visualize the results.

# Conclusions: 
Both models predicted that the stock prices would continue to decline.
In this project, a comprehensive analysis was conducted to predict the future stock prices of Netflix. The dataset was explored through statistical summaries and visualizations, revealing insights into the distribution, outliers, linearity, and correlations among the variables.

Two types of models, linear regression and LSTM, were implemented. The linear regression model performed well with a low RMSE value, while the LSTM model considered temporal dependencies in the data. Both models predicted a decline in Netflix stock prices.

# Industrial Use Case
The insights and predictions generated by this project can be valuable for investors, traders, and financial analysts who are interested in understanding and forecasting the stock prices of Netflix. By applying machine learning techniques, financial professionals can make informed decisions and develop investment strategies based on the predicted trends in stock prices.
